According to the Armenia mystic G. I Gurdjieff, the human machine consists of 3 centers: the thinking center or the conscious mind, the feeling center or the subconscious / instinctive processes, the moving center or the spinal column. 

In our daily life, the 3 centers are not always united: we smile when we are angry, we want to sit down but we canâ€™t stop moving, we have to work but can not stop scrolling facebook feeds. 

Classy ball is a simple training game that attempts to unit the 3 centers, in this game, the ball changes color once it hits the top and the bottom of the screen, you have to hit the space bar when the color changes 4 times and then 3 times, this completes one cycle and then repeat (4 times, 3 times...). The game is over once you missed one hit or hit in the wrong times. 

In this process, the 3 centers have to work together to achieve 1 activity - the thinking center counts, the feeling center follows the ball movement, and the moving center hits the space bar - therefore units the distracted centers and after prolonged practice, can help increase focus, will power and presence.
